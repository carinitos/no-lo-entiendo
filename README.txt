Source Material for Song Lyrics:
golang documentation
computer science textbook
old poetry from college
misc stuff from my google drive 

How to Use:
upload material to be "cut-up" into input directory
filename of input file doesnt matter
program reads the file and does the work
lyrics are written to a txt file in the output directory using the title you provided
output is 100 random sentences, key, chord pattern w/ chord names, and bpm
up to user to create a cohesive song using these pieces 
be creative, have fun :) 


NOTE: 
this program is not intended to be used with any copywritten material. 
everything used for my project was available in the public domain. 
using copywritten works is plagiarism and thus the artistic integrity is moot. 
have fun, but don't be a dweeb
